        <h3>Why to Learn Python?</h3>
        <lI>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</li><br>
        <li>Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:</li><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
            <li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
            <li>Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
            <li>Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Characteristics of Python</h2> 
    <div>
        <h3>Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
            <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
            <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
            <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
            <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
       
    <div>
        <h2>Hello World using Python.</h2>
              <p>Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>print ("Hello, Python!");</li>


              </ul>

             </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Applications of Python</h3>
                <p>As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
                    <li>Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
                    <li>Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
                    <li>A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
                    <li>Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
                    <li>Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
                    <li>Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
                    <li>Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
                    <li>GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
                    <li>Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>

                </ol>
