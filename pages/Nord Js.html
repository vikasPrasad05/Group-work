        <h2>Node.js Tutorial</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <lI>Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications. Node.js is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.</li><br>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
            <li>This tutorial is designed for software programmers who want to learn the basics of Node.js and its architectural concepts. This tutorial will give you enough understanding on all the necessary components of Node.js with suitable examples.</li><br>
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <li>Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript. As we are going to develop web-based applications using Node.js, it will be good if you have some understanding of other web technologies such as HTML, CSS, AJAX, etc.</li>
            

        </ul>
        <h2>Creating Node.js Application</h2>
        <ul>
          <h3>Step 1 - Import Required Module</h3>
          <p>We use the require directive to load the http module and store the returned HTTP instance into an http variable as follows −</p>
          <li>var http = require("http");</li>
          <h3>Step 2 - Create Server</h3>
          <p>We use the created http instance and call http.createServer() method to create a server instance and then we bind it at port 8081 using the listen method associated with the server instance. Pass it a function with parameters request and response. Write the sample implementation to always return "Hello World".</p>
         <p><img src="assets\img\Screenshot (10).png" width="500px" height="300px" alt=""></p>
          <p>The above code is enough to create an HTTP server which listens, i.e., waits for a request over 8081 port on the local machine.</p>
          <h3>Step 3 - Testing Request & Response</h3>
          <p>Let's put step 1 and 2 together in a file called main.js and start our HTTP server as shown below −</p>

    <h3>What is Nord JS?</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and its latest version is v0.10.36.</li><br>
            <li>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</li><br>
            <li>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.</li><br>
            <li>Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.</li><br>
            <li></li><br>
            <li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
            </li>
